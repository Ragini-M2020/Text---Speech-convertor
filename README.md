# Text---Speech-convertor
Created a text to speech converter using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The converter uses the SpeechSynthesis API to convert text to speech directly in the browser without the need for any external libraries.
 I included different languages for speech in the converter.
The converter has a simple user interface that allows users to enter text and select a language.
When the user clicks on the "listen" button, the text is converted to speech in the selected language.
Here are some of the specific steps you took to create the project:


STEPS:
I created a folder for the project and created the following files:
index.html
style.css
script.js
 added the necessary HTML code to the index.html file to create the user interface for the converter.
 added the necessary CSS code to the style.css file to style the user interface.
 added the necessary JavaScript code to the script.js file to convert the text to speech and play it back.
 tested the converter to make sure it was working properly.
I hope this gives you a rough overview of the project I made .
